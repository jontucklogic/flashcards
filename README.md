# Flashcards

This is my first **Express App** built from scratch!
I learned how use Express.js to build dynamic websites on the Node.js platform. In the process, I have learned some fundamental HTTP concepts that I can apply to any other framework.
## Concepts Learned From the Build:

 - Installing and Setting up Express 
 - Pug Templating 
 - Routing in Express
 - HTTP GET and POST
 - Basic Form Processing
 - Middleware
